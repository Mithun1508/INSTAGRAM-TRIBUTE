# Here is What I have Implemented 


👋 Getting started with ReactJS

⚙️ Setting up our Firebase backend

🏗️ Building the frontend

🔌 Connecting the frontend to Firebase

🗄️ Real-time database with Firebase

🔐 User authentication with Firebase

📸 Image upload with Firebase to create posts

💬 Adding comments to IG posts

🚀 Deploying with Firebase

# You can sign up to use it already, upload an image, and add comments 🤩 An awesome project, right?

# Pre-requisites
What you’ll need for this tutorial:

1.Knowledge of JavaScript

2.Node & NPM - To get started with the project, you’ll need to have Node and NPM installed on your local machine. To confirm they’re installed, run the following commands in your terminal:

node --v
npm --v
The Node Package Manager comes installed with Node, and it allows us to install various application dependencies. If you don’t have them installed, you can follow the instructions on the official Node.js website.

3.Yarn - Yarn is a package manager that would help us manage our application dependencies in a way that is several times faster and more reliable than NPM. You can install yarn using:

npm install --global yarn
4.React CLI - The react-cli (i.e. the React Command-Line Interface) is a tool built by the React team to help facilitate the rapid development of React applications. To install the React CLI run the following command:

npm install -g create-react-app
5.Google account - Using Firebase requires that a developer has a Google account. You can create one if you don’t have an account, here

6.Firebase CLI - To host your site with Firebase hosting, you need the Firebase CLI. Run the following command to install it:

npm install -g firebase-tools 
7.Git - You will also need the git cli installed on your local machine, as well as to have a GitHub account. If you don’t already have one, you can sign-up today. The git cli can be installed from the official Git website.

# My Learnings 
1)how to get started with React development and create the frontend for an Instagram clone application. 

2) We also looked at how to connect the frontend to a Firebase backend and deploy with Firebase. 

3)We were able to add MVP functionalities such as signing up, viewing posts, adding comments to posts. Feel free to add more functionalities to improve your developer skills.
